🚀 **About Me**

Hi, I’m Emmanuel Lordgreat-Adri — a Backend Developer and AWS Cloud enthusiast based in Accra, Ghana.

I specialize in building **scalable, reliable backend systems** using **PHP (Laravel)** and **Python (FastAPI, Django)**. I'm actively expanding my expertise in **cloud-native development with AWS** and enjoy solving complex problems that drive meaningful impact.

With a solid foundation in **systems design**, **API development**, and **team collaboration**, I create software that is not only technically sound but also **user-focused and well-documented**.

I’m passionate about using technology for good and currently open to opportunities with organizations looking to innovate and grow with the cloud.

> _“Turning complexity into clarity, one system at a time.”_

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
